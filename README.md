## Guitar Chordly

# User Flows

First, sign up for an account on Guitar Chordly. Once a user signs up, they will be able to look up chords, and then add any chords they want to their practice list. From their practice list, users can move any chords they practiced and learned to their mastered list. 

This app was designed in order to present guitarists with a means of learning chords. The practice list helps guitarists keep track of what chords they need to practice.

# List of Features

-Users can sign up, log in and log out (so they can keep track of their practice lists).
-Users can look up chords that are called on the backend displayed on the frontend.
-Users can view their list of practice chords.
-Users can move chords from their practice list to their "done" list. 

More features coming soon!

# API

Guitar Chordly uses an API that I created myself. The data in the API is served by a SQL database, and is accessed by a Node.js app. The database contains extensive information on dozens of guitar chord, and includes information about fingering, frets, strings, roots, and chord qualities.

# Tech Stack

-Node.js (backend, API)
-React (frontend/UI)
-SQL (database)

I also used this library to help render the chords in React: https://github.com/tombatossals/react-chords
